# Binary Encoding
This is a a binary encoding project for the class Embedded Systems in C.  
It was created by Sam Beckmann and Wesley Liao.

The goal was to encode a set of birthdays and ID numbers in the smallest format possible.  
The encoding we used can be found here: [https://gist.github.com/samvbeckmann/8d82f57f138b23c5e17c](here)  
The encoding uses 17 bits for each birthday + id.
